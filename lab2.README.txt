My solution to this lab was to first create the vertices for the hexagon shape and then
create a vertex and a color buffer for the hexagon. Then I created a model matrix in order
to store the next location of the shape. After that, I created a basic keyboard event function
called keydown that would be called whenever a keyboard key was pressed. This event function
read the input key code and determined which key was pressed in order to increment or
decrement that x and y positions of the shape. Lastly, the render function was used to
update the shapes location and then update the users screen.
